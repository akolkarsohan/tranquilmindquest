**Subject**: Re: Amazon SES Production Access Request - Additional Information

Hi AWS SES Team,

Thanks for reviewing my request. Here's the info you asked for:

**What I'm using SES for:**
I run TranquilMindQuest (https://tranquilmindquest.com), a mental wellness site. I need to send welcome emails when people subscribe to our newsletter, plus weekly newsletters with mental health tips and wellness content.

**How often:**
- Welcome emails go out right when someone subscribes
- Weekly newsletters go to all subscribers
- Expecting around 50-200 new subscribers per week initially
- Peak rate would be maybe 3-5 emails per minute

**My subscriber list:**
Everyone opts in by entering their email and clicking subscribe on my website. I don't buy lists - only people who sign up themselves. Emails are stored securely.

**Bounces and complaints:**
I'll remove bounced addresses automatically. Unsubscribes get processed within 24 hours (probably faster). Every email has an unsubscribe link. If someone marks it as spam, they're removed immediately. I know keeping a clean list matters for sender reputation.

**Email content:**
Welcome email thanks people and explains what they'll get. Weekly newsletters include mental health tips, mindfulness exercises, and wellness resources. All educational content - no promotional stuff.

**Verification:**
Domain (tranquilmindquest.com) and sender email (newsletter@tranquilmindquest.com) are both verified in SES. Using ap-south-1 region.

**Compliance:**
I'll follow AWS SES best practices and anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM, GDPR), monitor bounces/complaints, and only send to people who opt in.

Happy to answer any other questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
