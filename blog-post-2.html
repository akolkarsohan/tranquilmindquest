                            <p class="lead">Two years ago, I was a successful software engineer working 70-hour weeks, constantly connected to my devices, and completely disconnected from myself. This is the story of how I hit rock bottom and found my way back to balance.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you're reading this, chances are you're either experiencing burnout yourself or know someone who is. I want to share my journey not as a blueprint, but as proof that recovery is possible—even when it feels impossible.</p>

                            <p>Burnout isn't just being tired. It's a complete depletion of your physical, emotional, and mental resources. It's feeling like you're running on empty while the world expects you to keep giving. It's losing yourself in the pursuit of success and forgetting what truly matters.</p>

                            <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
                            
                            <p>It was 2 AM on a Tuesday when I found myself sobbing in my car outside the office. I had been working on a critical project for three weeks straight, sleeping an average of 4 hours per night, and surviving on coffee and takeout. My relationships were strained, my health was deteriorating, and I couldn't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Chronic fatigue that didn't improve with sleep</li>
                                    <li>Constant irritability and mood swings</li>
                                    <li>Loss of interest in activities I once loved</li>
                                    <li>Physical symptoms: headaches, muscle tension, digestive issues</li>
                                    <li>Difficulty concentrating and making decisions</li>
                                    <li>Feeling detached from my work and relationships</li>

                            <p>That night in my car, I realized I had become a stranger to myself. I was so focused on proving my worth through work that I had completely lost touch with who I was outside of my job. The person I had become was someone I didn't recognize—and certainly didn't like.</p>

                            <p>The next morning, I called in sick for the first time in two years. Not because I was physically ill, but because I was emotionally and mentally broken. It was the first step in admitting that I needed help.</p>

                            <p>Admitting I had a problem was only the beginning. The real work started when I had to figure out how to fix something I had been building for years. I started by researching burnout and was shocked to learn that it's now recognized as an occupational phenomenon by the World Health Organization.</p>
                            
                            <p>My first step was to see a therapist. I had always been skeptical of therapy, thinking I could handle my problems on my own. But I quickly realized that professional help wasn't a sign of weakness—it was a sign of strength and self-awareness.</p>

                            <p>One of the most difficult parts was telling my manager about my situation. I was terrified of being seen as weak or unreliable. But to my surprise, she was incredibly supportive and helped me create a plan to reduce my workload gradually.</p>

                            <p>My therapist suggested I try mindfulness meditation. I was skeptical—it seemed too simple to address such a complex problem. But I was desperate enough to try anything.</p>
                            
                            <p>I started with just 5 minutes a day using a meditation app. At first, my mind was so busy that I felt like I was failing at meditation. But my therapist explained that the goal wasn't to empty my mind, but to observe my thoughts without judgment.</p>

I started to recognize when I was getting overwhelmed before it became unmanageable. Most importantly, I began to feel more connected to the present moment instead of constantly worrying about the future.</p>

                            <p>Mindfulness taught me that I didn't have to be perfect. I could acknowledge my feelings without being consumed by them. This was revolutionary for someone who had spent years trying to control every aspect of my life.</p>

                            <h2>Setting Boundaries</h2>
                            
                            <p>One of the hardest lessons I had to learn was how to set boundaries. I had always been the person who said "yes" to everything, afraid of disappointing others or missing opportunities. But this people-pleasing behavior was killing me.</p>
                            
                            <p>I started small. I began by setting a hard stop time for work each day. No more checking emails after 6 PM. No more working on weekends unless there was a true emergency. At first, I felt guilty and anxious about what I might be missing. But gradually, I began to see that the world didn't end when I wasn't available 24/7.</p>

                            <div class="callout-box">
                                <h4>Boundaries That Changed My Life:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Work Hours:</strong> 9 AM to 6 PM, no exceptions</li>
                                    <li><strong>Email:</strong> Check only twice per day, not constantly</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weekends:</strong> Completely work-free unless emergency</li>
                                    <li><strong>Vacation:</strong> Take all allocated time off, no working remotely</li>
                                    <li><strong>Meetings:</strong> Decline unnecessary meetings, keep others to 30 minutes</li>
                                    <li><strong>Personal Time:</strong> One hour daily for myself, no interruptions</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Setting boundaries wasn't just about work. I also had to learn to say no to social obligations when I was tired, to ask for help when I needed it, and to prioritize my own needs without feeling selfish.</p>

                            <p>This was incredibly difficult because it went against everything I had been taught about success. I had to unlearn the belief that my worth was tied to my productivity and availability.</p>

                            <h2>The Recovery Process</h2>
                            
                            <p>Recovery wasn't linear. There were days when I felt like I was making progress, and others when I felt like I was backsliding. I had to learn to be patient with myself and celebrate small victories.</p>
                            
                            <p>After three months of therapy and mindfulness practice, I started to feel like myself again. I was sleeping better, eating regularly, and actually enjoying my work instead of dreading it. But the real breakthrough came when I realized that I had been using work to avoid dealing with deeper issues.</p>

                            <p>I had been using busyness as a way to numb uncomfortable emotions. When I slowed down and started paying attention to my feelings, I discovered that I had been carrying around years of unresolved stress, anxiety, and even grief. Work had become my escape from these feelings, but it had also become my prison.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> 10 minutes of meditation before checking phone</li>
                                    <li><strong>Work:</strong> Focused work blocks with 5-minute breaks every hour</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Actual lunch break, away from desk, preferably outside</li>
                                    <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Wind-down routine with no screens 1 hour before bed</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> One activity purely for enjoyment, no productivity goals</li>

                            <p>Six months into my recovery, I made a decision that would change everything: I asked for a sabbatical. My company offered a 3-month unpaid leave program, and I decided to take it. This time away from work allowed me to focus entirely on my healing and to rediscover who I was outside of my professional identity.</p>
